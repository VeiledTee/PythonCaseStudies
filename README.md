# PythonCaseStudies
6 Case Studies from Harvard's edX course "Python for Research". Case Study 7 (Movies) also dives slightly into linear and logistic regression. Lots of pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib.pyplot used throughout. Originally written in PyCharm Community Edition 2020.

Case Study 2: Language Processing will not be included because of the insane amount of files required for it to work correctly. Apologies for any inconvenience.
